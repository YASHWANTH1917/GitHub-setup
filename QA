DevOps & Cloud Interview Answers 🚀
1️⃣ I want to deploy 10 applications at a time. How to do it?
To deploy multiple applications simultaneously, you can use:
✅ Kubernetes → Deploy 10 applications as separate deployments in a single cluster.
✅ Docker Compose → Define multiple services in a docker-compose.yml file.
✅ CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI) → Use parallel jobs to trigger deployments.
✅ Terraform/Ansible → Automate infrastructure deployment and application deployment together.
✅ AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for containerized apps.

2️⃣ What is Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?
🔹 Continuous Integration (CI) → Developers push code frequently, and automated tests run to validate changes (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).
🔹 Continuous Delivery (CD) → Code is automatically built, tested, and deployed to a staging environment but requires manual approval for production.
🔹 Continuous Deployment (CD) → Fully automated pipeline where code changes go live without manual intervention.

📌 Example:

CI: A developer pushes code → Automated tests run.
CD (Delivery): After passing tests, the build is deployed to a staging environment for approval.
CD (Deployment): If automated, the changes go live without manual approval.
3️⃣ What is the difference between ALB and NLB?
Feature	ALB (Application Load Balancer)	NLB (Network Load Balancer)
Protocol	Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)	Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
Routing	Path-based, host-based	Direct to IP/port
Performance	Slightly slower (more processing)	Faster (low latency)
Use case	Web applications, API Gateway	Low-latency apps, gaming, VoIP
Example	Routing requests to microservices	Handling millions of requests quickly
4️⃣ How to integrate an S3 bucket with an EC2 instance?
📌 Steps:
1️⃣ Create an S3 bucket (aws s3 mb s3://mybucket)
2️⃣ Attach an IAM role with S3 permissions to the EC2 instance.
3️⃣ Install AWS CLI on the EC2 instance (sudo yum install aws-cli -y).
4️⃣ Configure AWS credentials (aws configure).
5️⃣ Access S3 bucket from EC2

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/myfile.txt /home/ec2-user/
5️⃣ How does an end-user request reach an application?
📌 Stages involved:
1️⃣ User makes a request from a browser (https://myapp.com).
2️⃣ DNS Resolution → Resolves myapp.com to an IP address.
3️⃣ Load Balancer (ALB/NLB) → Routes traffic to the right server.
4️⃣ Firewall/Security Group Check → Allows valid requests.
5️⃣ Application Server (EC2/K8s/ECS) → Handles the request.
6️⃣ Database Interaction (if needed) → Retrieves data from RDS/DynamoDB.
7️⃣ Response Sent Back → User sees the webpage.

6️⃣ What is the difference between Observability and Monitoring?
Feature	Monitoring	Observability
Purpose	Detect known issues	Discover unknown issues
Data Type	Metrics & logs	Logs, metrics, traces
Example	Checking CPU usage	Debugging why a service failed
Tools	Prometheus, Grafana	OpenTelemetry, Datadog
7️⃣ How can you secure a CI/CD pipeline?
✅ Use IAM roles & least privilege access.
✅ Enable secret management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
✅ Code scanning → Use tools like SonarQube, Snyk for vulnerability detection.
✅ Restrict direct production access (manual approvals for critical changes).
✅ Use signed artifacts & checksum validation.

8️⃣ Do you have hands-on experience with Terraform workspaces, and what does it mean?
✅ Terraform Workspaces allow managing multiple environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) in the same codebase.
📌 Example:

terraform workspace new dev → Creates a Dev workspace
terraform workspace new prod → Creates a Prod workspace
terraform workspace select dev → Switch to Dev workspace
💡 Benefit: No need to manage separate Terraform directories for different environments.

9️⃣ In AWS, how to configure an S3 bucket as a backend in Terraform and implement state locking?
📌 Steps:
1️⃣ Create an S3 bucket for storing Terraform state.
2️⃣ Create a DynamoDB table for state locking.
3️⃣ Define backend in terraform code:

hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
  }
}
✅ This ensures the Terraform state is stored safely, and DynamoDB prevents multiple users from modifying it simultaneously (state locking).

🔟 What is a Helm chart, and can you explain your experience with Helm charts?
📌 Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deploying applications using predefined templates (Charts).

✅ Example of Helm Chart Deployment:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm install myapp ./mychart
💡 Experience:

Used Helm to deploy microservices in Kubernetes.
Created custom Helm charts with values.yaml for different environments.
Managed application upgrades with helm upgrade.
